# Zen Koans: Embracing the Beautiful Confusion

**A 20-Minute Dharma Talk**

---- 

## Opening (2 minutes)

Good morning, everyone. Before we begin, I want to share something I say at the start of all my teachings: You don't need to use what you learn from Buddhism to become a Buddhist. You can use what you learn to simply be a better whatever you already are.

Today we're going to talk about something that might feel strange, frustrating, and even a little absurd at times—Zen koans. And I want to be upfront with you: by the end of this talk, you might be more confused than when we started. And that would actually be perfect fine.

Some of you have encountered koans through the podcast over the years. For others, this might be completely new territory. Either way, I want us to approach this together as if we're all beginners, because honestly, that's the only way to approach koans anyway.

Here's why we're talking about this today: I've created a new space in our community for exploring koans together. I want to make sure we're approaching it in a way that serves the actual purpose of koans. Because it's important to remember—koans aren't riddles to solve. They're not puzzles where someone has the right answer and someone else has the wrong answer. They're something else entirely.
## WHY This Matters (4 minutes)

Let me tell you what I've noticed about being human. We are absolutely addicted to certainty. We want answers. We want resolution, we want things to be solved and for things to make sense. We want to know that we got it right.

Think about how uncomfortable it feels when you don't know something. When someone asks you a question and you don't have an answer. When life throws you a curveball and you can't figure out what to do. That feeling in your chest, that slight panic, that reaching for something solid to hold onto—we all feel it. It's part of the human experience.

And here's what we do: we race toward answers. Any answer. Even a bad answer feels better than no answer. We'd rather be wrong with certainty than right with doubt. (The jerk that cuts us off)

But life doesn't work that way, does it? Life is full of ambiguity. Full of situations where there isn't a clear right or wrong. Full of moments where we simply don't know. And yet we've never been trained for that. We've been trained since childhood to seek the correct answer, to solve the problem, to figure it out.

What if I told you there's an entire practice designed specifically to train you to be comfortable with not knowing? To actually embrace confusion? To sit in the middle of uncertainty and discover that you don't need to escape it?

That's what koans are for.

And what's at stake here? When we can't tolerate not-knowing, we make premature decisions. We grasp at incomplete understanding and call it wisdom. We reduce the rich mystery of life into tidy little boxes that make us feel safe but keep us small.

But when we learn to sit with confusion, when we develop what Zen calls "don't-know mind," something remarkable happens. We become available to insights that don't come through logical thinking. We open ourselves to understanding that emerges not from solving but from surrendering.

In Zen, there is a well-known saying: "Great doubt, great awakening. Little doubt, little awakening. No doubt, no awakening." This phrase emphasizes the importance of bringing a deep, questioning spirit—sometimes described as existential or "Great Doubt"—to Zen practice in order to open the way to true insight or awakening. The greater the intensity of one's inquiry and doubt, the deeper the potential for transformation and realization; and the flip side is, without such profound questioning, awakening is not possible.

## HOW - The Nature of Koans (3-4 minutes)

So what exactly is a koan? The word literally means "public case" in Chinese, like a legal precedent. Koans emerged in Tang Dynasty China and were further developed in Japanese Zen traditions. They're stories, questions, or statements from interactions between Zen masters and students, compiled over centuries.

But here's what they're not: they're not riddles with clever answers. They're not intellectual puzzles. They're not meant to be figured out with your thinking mind.

Koans are designed to break your thinking mind. To jam up the gears of your usual way of processing information. They're like a computer program that crashes the operating system so you can see the code, what's running underneath.

Think of it this way: your rational mind is an incredible tool. It's great for planning, analyzing, solving problems. But it's terrible at accessing certain kinds of wisdom. It's like trying to use a hammer to paint a picture. The tool isn't broken—it's just the wrong tool for the job.

Koans create what we might call cognitive dissonance—they present something that doesn't compute. And in that moment of not-computing, something else becomes possible. A different way of seeing. A shift in perspective that can't be thought, it can only experienced.

The purpose isn't to find the answer. The purpose is to let the question work on you. To carry it with you. To wrestle with it. To let it confuse you so thoroughly that eventually something in you lets go of needing to understand.

And here's the beautiful paradox: it's often when you stop trying to solve the koan that something shifts. Not because you gave up, but because you finally stopped getting in your own way.

## WHAT - Living with Koans (11 minutes)

### The Practice of Sitting with Confusion (3-4 minutes)

Let me share one of my favorite koans with you. It's about a nun named Chiyono who studied for many years under Zen Master Buko at Engakuji temple in Kamakura. She practiced diligently, meditated faithfully, studied earnestly. But still, she could not attain what's called "the fruits of meditation"—that breakthrough, that awakening she was seeking.

One moonlit night, she was carrying water in an old wooden pail bound together with bamboo strips. She was being so careful, walking so mindfully, trying not to spill a drop.

Then the bamboo broke. The bottom fell out of the pail. The water rushed out, and with it, the reflection of the moon disappeared.

At that moment, she was set free.

She said: "No more water in the pail, no more moon in the water."

Now, here's where we might be tempted to analyze this. To figure out what it means. What does the water represent? What about the moon? What's the symbolism of the breaking pail?

But watch what happens when you try to solve it. You're doing exactly what Chiyono was doing before the pail broke—carefully trying to hold it all together, trying not to spill, trying to get it right.

The old pail is Chiyono. It's also you and me. The greatest attachment we have is attachment to our idea of ourselves—this carefully constructed identity we're trying to preserve, trying to protect, trying to perfect.

The harder Chiyono tried to attain enlightenment, the more self-conscious she became. The more careful she was not to break the pail. Sound familiar? How much energy do we spend trying to keep our sense of self intact? Trying not to fail, trying not to look foolish, trying to maintain control?

**For me, here's what the koan reveals: nothing real happens until something breaks.** Until the ego-self—that constructed identity—cracks open. Until the bottom falls out and we realize we were trying to hold onto something that was already empty.

But notice—I just gave you an explanation of the koan. And now watch what your mind wants to do. It wants to say, "Ah, I get it now. I understand." And in that moment of thinking you understand, you've missed it entirely.

Because understanding a koan intellectually is like looking at a picture of the moon in the water. The real moon is still above, unreflected. The real insight is still waiting for your own bottom to fall out.

This is why we sit with koans rather than solve them. We carry them with us. We let them work on us in ways we can't predict or control.

### Multiple Ways of Seeing (3-4 minutes)

Here's what I want you to understand about the community space we've created for discussing koans: when someone shares their reflection on a koan, they're not giving you the answer. They're sharing what got shaken loose in them. What broke open. What confused them. What wouldn't leave them alone.

And when you read their reflection, you're not comparing your understanding to theirs to see who got it right. You're looking through a different window into the same mystery.

Imagine ten people looking at the same mountain from different sides. One person sees it covered in snow. Another sees a green forest. Another sees steep cliffs. Another sees a gentle slope. Are any of them wrong? They're all describing the same mountain, but from their unique vantage point.

This is how we work with koans together. Not comparing answers but sharing perspectives. Not debating interpretations but exploring what each person sees from where they stand.

Someone might share how "no water, no moon" spoke to them about letting go of a relationship that ended. Another person might connect it to releasing expectations about their career. Someone else might find it speaks to their meditation practice, or their parenting, or their fear of death.

And here's what's wild—they're all right. And they're all wrong. Or maybe more accurately, right and wrong don't apply here. The koan isn't meant to have one correct interpretation. **It's meant to crack something open in whoever encounters it.**

This is why I don't want you approaching the community space thinking, "I need to figure this out so I can post the right answer." Instead, approach it thinking, "I'm going to sit with this until something moves in me, and then I'll share what moved."

And when you read others' posts, don't ask "Is that right?" Ask "What does their seeing help me see?"

Be light about it too. Koans are absurd by design. They're supposed to be. Don't take it so seriously that you lose the playfulness of wrestling with something that refuses to be pinned down. There's something delightfully frustrating about koans, and that frustration is part of the medicine.

### Living the Real-Life Koans (3-4 minutes)

But here's where this gets really practical, really relevant to daily life.

The koans we study—these old stories from Zen masters—they're practice ground for the real koans. The ones life throws at you when you least expect it.

You know those moments I'm talking about. When the bottom falls out of your pail. When the ground disappears beneath your feet. When you suddenly don't know what to do, who you are, or what comes next.

Maybe it's getting laid off from a job you were sure was secure. Maybe it's a diagnosis that changes everything. Maybe it's your teenager making choices you can't understand or control. Maybe it's your own mind doing things you can't predict—anxiety showing up, depression settling in, thoughts that won't stop racing.

These are the real koans. The moments of groundlessness. The times when all your usual strategies for keeping the pail intact suddenly don't work.

And what do we typically do in those moments? We panic. We scramble. We try desperately to find solid ground again. We reach for answers, solutions, fixes. We need to know what to do. We need to know it will be okay. We need to know something, ANYTHING, because NOT KNOWING is what we're really afraid of, and we haven't practiced.

But what if those moments of not-knowing, those experiences of groundlessness, are exactly what the formal koans are preparing us for?

What if the practice of sitting with a confusing koan, carrying it with you, letting it work on you without needing to solve it—what if that's training you to sit with the confusion of real life without needing to escape it?

Because here's the truth: some of life's biggest questions don't have answers. Some situations don't have solutions. Some pain doesn't have a fix. Some uncertainty doesn't get resolved.

And if we've never practiced being with that, never developed the capacity to sit in the middle of not-knowing without falling apart, then every time life gets uncertain—which is often—we suffer unnecessarily.

The koan practice isn't separate from your life. It's preparation for your life. It's building your tolerance for ambiguity. Your capacity to hold mystery without collapsing it into premature understanding. Your ability to keep walking when you can't see the path.

That moment when Chiyono's pail broke—that's not just her moment. That's your moment too. It's every moment when what you were holding onto falls away. When the reflection of the moon disappears. When the bottom drops out.

And the question isn't "How do I prevent the breaking?" The question is "Can I be present when it breaks? Can I stay with what's revealed when the water spills out, and the reflection is gone?"

## Call to Action (2 minutes)

So here's what I'm inviting you into with our new community space around koans.

First, approach it without the pressure to understand. If you read a koan and have absolutely no idea what it means, that's perfect. Sit with that uncertainty. Carry it with you. Let it confuse you. Let it frustrate you. Let it work on you in ways you can't control.

Second, if and when you do share your reflections, share what's moving in you, not what you think the right answer is. Share your confusion. Share your questions. Share what won't leave you alone about it. That's more valuable than any interpretation.

Third, when you read others' reflections, read them as windows, not comparisons. They're showing you how they're seeing. That doesn't mean you need to see the same way, or even see the same thing. **Let their perspective inform yours without replacing yours.**

And finally, remember this isn't just about old Zen stories. This is about training for real life. For the moments when your pail breaks. For the times when the ground disappears. For the experiences of not-knowing that are inevitable in a human life.

The koan is REALLY asking is: **Can you be with what is without needing to fix it, solve it, or understand it?**

And sometimes, that's exactly when the real insight comes. Not when you figure it out, but when you finally stop trying to.

The bottom falls out. No more water in the pail. No more moon in the water.

And something real begins.

Thank you for being here today, and for your willingness to step into confusion together. That takes courage.
