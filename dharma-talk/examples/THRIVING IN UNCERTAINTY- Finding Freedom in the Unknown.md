# THRIVING IN UNCERTAINTY: Finding Freedom in the Unknown
*A 30-Minute Dharma Talk for Thrive Community*

---

## Opening

Good morning, everyone. Thank you for welcoming me to the Thrive community today. Before we begin, I want to share something I say at the start of all my presentations: "Don't use what you learn from Buddhism to become a Buddhist. You can use what you learn to simply be a better whatever you already are."

I love that this community is called Thrive, because that's exactly what we're exploring today—how to thrive within uncertainty, not in spite of it. How to find freedom not by escaping the unknown, but by learning to live there.

**[SLIDE: Tools/Hardware Store Image]**

Before we dive in, let me give you a framework for how I approach these teachings. Imagine walking into a hardware store. You see hammers, screwdrivers, wrenches, saws. Now imagine someone asking, "Which one is the right tool?" 

The question doesn't make sense, does it? The right tool depends on what you're trying to do. You don't use a hammer to turn a screw.

This is how I understand Buddhism—not as "the right" path, but as a collection of tools. In Buddhism, we call this "skillful means"—using the appropriate method for the specific situation. The wisdom isn't in having the tools; it's in knowing which tool fits which moment.

Today, I'm sharing some tools from the Buddhist toolkit. Take what serves you. Leave what doesn't. Build your own toolkit for navigating this uncertain, beautiful, confusing experience we call life.

## The Mystery Box Exercise

**[SLIDE: Mystery Box with Question Marks]**

Let's try something. Look at this box on the screen. Imagine it contains the answers to all of life's mysteries.

Who killed Kennedy? It's in there. What happened to Amelia Earhart? In the box. 

But more than that—the big existential questions. Who am I? Why am I here? What happens when we die? What is the meaning of life? Every answer you've ever wanted. It's all in this box.
How many of you would want to know what's in this box?

*[Acknowledge the raised hands]*

Of course. This desire to know is completely natural. We're curious creatures. We want to understand. We want answers. We want certainty.

Life's big existential questions are like this unopenable box. We desperately want to know what's inside, but we can't. Not with absolute certainty.

Most of the world's ideologies and belief systems approach this mystery box genuinely believing they know what's inside. And there's real comfort in that. Even if you can't verify it yourself, just believing someone knows can ease that existential anxiety we all carry.

But Buddhism does something different. Buddhism doesn't claim to know what's in the box. Instead, it turns the questions around:

- Where did this need to know come from?
- Why do I feel this urgency to have answers?
- Why do I even think there's anything at all in that box?

Buddhism invites us to examine our relationship with not-knowing rather than rushing to fill the void with answers we can't verify.

## Two Paths: The Fork in the Road

**[SLIDE: Two Paths - "Peace of Knowing" vs. "Peace of Not Knowing"]**

Imagine standing at a crossroads with two paths before you.

The first path is marked "The Peace of Knowing." This is where someone tells you what's in the mystery box, and you believe them. That belief brings peace, comfort, security.

**[SLIDE: The "Knowing" path splits into many paths representing world religions]**

But watch what happens when we follow that path further. It splits into many different paths. One says, "This is the truth." Another says, "No, it's this way." We end up with countless paths, each claiming to have the answer.

But how can they all be right when they're saying different things?

**[SLIDE: Return to two paths, but now the sign says "thinking you know"]**
Look at that first path again. "The Peace of Knowing" really means "The Peace of THINKING You Know."
This is really important to understand: We never actually KNOW what's in that unopenable box. We can only BELIEVE we know. And that belief does bring peace—real, genuine peace. I'm not dismissing that.

But thinking we know isn't the same as actually knowing.

Imagine this scenario: Before I leave today, I decide to reveal what's in the box. Standing here, I mumble something—maybe the microphone cuts out, maybe I'm not speaking clearly. 

Some of you hear "diamond band." Others hear "diamondback"—as in rattlesnake. Someone in the back might hear "dime and tacks." Each person hears something different, but everyone who caught something believes they heard THE answer.

**[SLIDE: Various objects that were heard]**

After I leave, you're all satisfied. You think you know what's in the box. But then you start comparing notes. "Wait, you heard diamond band? I heard diamondback!" "No, no, it was definitely dime and tacks."

How many of you heard something entirely different?

Now those who didn't hear me at all have to rely on what others say they heard. And imagine this gets passed along for generations—like a game of telephone stretching across centuries. The message changes, evolves, splits into different versions. Each group is absolutely certain they have the right version of what was originally said.

And remember, here's the important part: Anyone feeling peace because they "know" what's in the box isn't at peace because they actually know. They're at peace because they THINK they know.

But the moment you encounter someone with a different answer—the moment you start debating which version is correct—that discomfort returns. The uncertainty creeps back in. Because your peace wasn't built on knowing; it was built on believing you knew. That's why "doubt" is such a scary thing when you're on the path of certainty.

**[SLIDE: Back to the signs]**

So here we are at the crossroads. You can go left, and back down the path of thinking you know, looking for better answers, interpretations that are more clear, find sources that are more authoritative. There's nothing wrong with that. Many people live meaningful lives on that path.

But there's another path. The path of not knowing. The path of saying, "I don't know what's in the box. I don't know if it's even possible to know. I don't know what happens when we die. And maybe that's okay."

This path feels uncomfortable at first. We've been conditioned to seek answers, to build on solid ground. To have a "firm foundation," but what if there's freedom in not-knowing? What if this freedom is called groundlessness?

## Tool 1: Groundlessness - Learning to Fall

**[SLIDE: Person standing at edge of abyss, looking down]**

Imagine standing at the edge of a bottomless abyss. You look down into vast emptiness. No bottom. Just endless depth.

Suddenly, the ground beneath you begins to shake. You lose your balance.

**[SLIDE: Person falling in the abyss]**

Now, you're falling.

Every instinct screams: grab something, ANYTHING. Your arms flail, desperate for something solid to hold onto.

**[SLIDE: Person grabbing the rock]**

This is exactly what life is like. We're all in free fall from the moment we're born. We don't know where we came from. We don't know where we're going. We're just... falling, in the uncertainty of life.

**[SLIDE: Labeled rocks]**

And we spend our entire lives trying to grab onto things that will stop the fall or at least slow it down:
- Our identities
- Our beliefs and convictions
- Our opinions 
- Our relationships
- Our achievements
- Our possessions

**[SLIDE: Person looking into the void]**

But here's what we don't realize: everything we're grabbing onto is also falling. Even the solid foundation that we thought we were standing on, before we fell in.

**[SLIDE: Person looking into the void]**

It was also falling. Everything in life is constantly changing; it always has been, and it always will be. 

That career you're holding onto? It's falling too. Relationships? Falling. Those beliefs about how the world works? They're rocks in free fall, just like you, and just like me.

But, here's a comforting thought: we're all falling together! Some are standing on what they think is solid ground, others are clutching onto other falling things, desperately hoping to feel a sense of certainty.

In Buddhism, we call this "groundlessness." The recognition that there is no solid ground. There never was. There never will be.

But here's where it gets interesting, because this could feel terrifying and scary, OR it could be the start of feeling true freedom and liberation.

**[SLIDE: Person falling peacefully with arms spread wide]**

What if, instead of frantically grabbing at things, you just... accepted the fall? Accepted the fact that life is full of uncertainty.

What if you said, "Okay. I'm falling. Everything is falling. This is what life is."

When we accept the nature of reality, that things are impermanent, that many, if not most, questions simply can't be answered, something remarkable happens. 

The panic subsides. The desperation fades. Yes, you're still falling, but now there's peace in it. There's even a strange kind of freedom.

Buddhist teacher Pema Chödrön puts it beautifully: "Anyone who has ever sat on a meditation cushion knows that meditation is not about getting comfortable. It's about being willing to stay present with whatever arises, without trying to fix it or change it or make it go away."

When you accept groundlessness, you stop exhausting yourself trying to stop the unstoppable. You stop fighting reality. You can actually start to experience the fall itself—the rush of air, the sensation of movement, the vast spaciousness around you.

This is the peace of not knowing—not because you've found solid ground, but because you've accepted there isn't any. And in that acceptance, paradoxically, you find a different kind of stability. The stability of being okay with instability.

## Tool 2: Life as a Koan - The Story of Chiyono

**[SLIDE: Image of zen circle or meditation hall]**

In Zen Buddhism, there's a practice called "koan study." A koan is essentially an unsolvable riddle designed to short-circuit your logical mind. A famous one you might have heard is: "What is the sound of one hand clapping?"

Try to answer that logically. You can't. One hand doesn't make a clapping sound. But your mind—oh, your mind wants to solve it so badly. It'll tie itself in knots trying to figure out the "right" answer.

That's the whole point. The koan isn't meant to be solved. It's meant to exhaust your need to solve everything. It's meant to bring you face-to-face with the limits of logical thinking. It's meant to make you more comfortable with not knowing what's in that darn box.

In many ways, life itself is like a koan—an unsolvable riddle that we keep trying to solve anyway.

Let me tell you about Chiyono, a Buddhist nun who lived in 13th-century Japan.

**[SLIDE: Image of a woman carrying a wooden pail at night]**

For years, Chiyono struggled with awakening. She studied. She meditated. She contemplated the deepest questions of existence. Like many of us, she was trying to figure it all out, trying to solve the riddle of life.

Every evening, she would walk to the well with an old wooden pail held together with bamboo strips. She'd fill it with water and carry it back, watching her reflection ripple in the water as she walked.

One night, as she was carrying the full pail, the bamboo strips suddenly broke. The bottom fell out. The water crashed to the ground and disappeared into the earth.

In that moment, Chiyono looked down at the broken pail. No more water. No more reflection. Just an empty, broken container.

And she awakened.

**[SLIDE: Poem]**

She wrote this poem:

*"In this way and that, I tried to hold the pail together,*  
*hoping the weak bamboo would never break.*  
*Suddenly the bottom fell out.*  
*No more water in the pail!*  
*No more moon reflection in the water!"*

Think about your own life. Haven't you been Chiyono, trying desperately to hold your pail together? Haven't we all?
The pail is everything we use to contain and make sense of life:
- Our worldview that explains everything
- Our certainty about what's true
- Our containers for understanding reality
- Our frameworks that promise if we just follow the rules, everything will work out

We try so hard to keep these containers intact. We reinforce them when they start to weaken. We patch the cracks. We add more bamboo strips.

Because we're terrified of what happens if the bottom falls out. If we lose the water—our certainty, our answers, our sense of solid ground—what's left?

But Chiyono discovered something profound: it's only when the pail breaks that we stop staring at the reflection. It's only when we lose the water that we can see the actual moon, not just its reflection.

The reflection was never the moon. Your beliefs about reality were never reality itself. The water in your pail was just water in a pail.

Many of you have already experienced your pail breaking. That's why you're here. The container you used to make sense of everything has broken. The water has spilled out. You might feel like you've lost everything.

But maybe—just maybe—you haven't lost anything real. Maybe you've just lost the reflection so you can finally see the actual moon.

Maybe the breaking isn't the disaster. Maybe it's the awakening.

Like a koan that can't be solved, life keeps presenting us with questions that have no answers. And like Chiyono, we exhaust ourselves trying to hold it all together, trying to solve the unsolvable. But when we finally let the bottom fall out—when we stop trying to contain the uncontainable—that's when something real can happen.

## Tool 3: The Blind Men and the Elephant

**[SLIDE: Blind men touching different parts of elephant]**

There's an ancient parable about six blind men who encounter an elephant for the first time.

The first touches the leg and says, "An elephant is like a pillar!"  
The second touches the tail: "No, an elephant is like a rope!"  
The third touches the trunk: "You're both wrong—it's like a thick snake!"  
The fourth touches the ear: "It's like a large fan!"  
The fifth touches the belly: "It's like a wall!"  
The sixth touches the tusk: "It's like a solid pipe!"

They argue endlessly, each absolutely certain they know what an elephant is. Each has direct, personal experience. Each is telling the truth about what they've touched. And each is completely wrong about what an elephant actually is.

This is all of us, all the time.
We're all blind people touching different parts of reality, absolutely convinced we know what reality is. We fight about it. We build entire worldviews based on the small part we've touched. We're certain others are wrong because their experience doesn't match ours.

But here's what we miss: Everyone is touching something real. The leg is real. The trunk is real. The tusk is real. They're all parts of the same elephant.

Your experience of reality is real and valid. So is theirs. But neither of you has the complete picture. None of us do.

I can only ever be Noah at this point in time and space. I'll never know what it's like to be you. I'll never know what it's like to be anyone else. I'll never know what it's like to live in the past or future. I only know what it's like to be me, right now, in this moment.

An incredible shift happens when we move from "Whose perspective is right?" to "How can we understand each other's piece of the elephant?"

Instead of "You're wrong about reality," we say, "Help me understand what you're experiencing."

This is especially powerful in family disagreements, political discussions, or any conflict where people are convinced they're right. You touched the trunk. They touched the leg. You're both describing genuine experience. Neither has the complete picture.

The peace of not knowing means recognizing that your perspective is always limited, always partial. And instead of fighting about whose partial view is correct, we can get curious about each other's experiences.

## Tool 4: Life is Tetris, Not Chess

**[SLIDE: Tetris vs. Chess]**

This is my favorite framework, the one I return to when life feels overwhelming.

Most of us go through life thinking we're playing chess.

In chess, the game is calculated and predictable. You can plan strategy. You can think moves ahead. There's a "right way" to play. There are masters who've figured it out. The board never changes. The rules never change. You're in control.

We think life works like this: "If I make the right moves, I'll win. If I get the right education, find the right partner, make the right amount of money, make the right decisions—then I'll win at life."

But what if life isn't chess at all?

What if life is Tetris?

In Tetris, you don't know what piece is coming next. Pieces appear at the top of the screen, and you have about three seconds to figure out what to do with them. You can rotate the piece, move it left or right, but you can't choose what shows up.

You play until the game ends. The pieces keep coming faster, and eventually, the screen fills up and the game is over.

That's life.

You don't know what's coming next. A relationship might end. A job might appear. An illness might arrive. A joy might surprise you. You don't know.

You have limited control. You can respond to what shows up—rotate the piece, find a place for it. But you can't control what appears.

There's no "winning" at life. No finish line where you say, "I did it perfectly." 

You just play until the game ends. You're here. The pieces are coming. You do your best with each one. And eventually, the game ends. For all of us. We don't know when.

Once you really understand this—that life is Tetris, not chess—something shifts.

You stop trying to plan the perfect life. You stop believing there's some formula for guaranteed success. You start responding to what actually shows up instead of being frustrated that it's not what you wanted or what you planned.

Life is an experience to be had, not a game to be won.

The peace of not knowing means accepting you're playing Tetris, not chess. It means being okay with not knowing what piece comes next. It means developing the flexibility to work with whatever shows up, rather than demanding life give you the pieces you want.

## Closing: The Invitation

**[SLIDE: Two paths - "Peace of Thinking You Know" vs. "Peace of Not Knowing"]**

So here we are, back where we started. Two paths.

You've now seen what the path of not knowing looks like. It's not about having no beliefs or becoming nihilistic. It's not about giving up or checking out.

It's about holding everything lightly. It's about being okay when the bottom falls out of the pail. It's about developing tools to thrive in uncertainty. It's about playing Tetris with grace instead of demanding life be chess.

It's about freedom. Real freedom. Not the freedom from finally having all the answers, but the freedom that comes from being okay without them.

When you walk the path of thinking you know, you have to defend it. You have to protect it. You have to resist anything that challenges it. You clutch your falling rocks desperately.

When you walk the path of not knowing, you're free to be curious. Free to change. Free to grow. Free to say "I don't know" without it being a crisis. Free to learn. Free to be surprised. Free to enjoy the sensation of falling.

You've already survived your pail breaking. You've already discovered that what you thought was solid ground was just another falling rock.

The question isn't "Can I handle uncertainty?" You're already doing it. Look—we know a lot, but there's infinitely more we don't know. We don't even know what we don't know. Uncertainty IS reality.

The question is: "Can I learn to thrive in uncertainty?"

I believe you can. These tools—and many more you'll discover—can help you do exactly that.

You don't need to master all of these. Just take what resonates. Keep what serves you.

When you feel yourself clutching a rock desperately, remember—you're already falling. The rock isn't saving you.

When you're certain you're right and someone else is wrong, remember—you're both touching different parts of the elephant.

When life feels overwhelming, remember—it's Tetris, not chess. You don't need to know what piece comes next.

When the bottom falls out of your pail again—because it will—remember Chiyono. Nothing real happens until something breaks. You're not losing truth; you're losing your reflection of it.

The mystery box is still there. You still don't know what's in it. You might never know.

And that's okay.

You can thrive anyway. You can be at peace anyway. You can live a meaningful, beautiful life anyway.

Welcome to the path of not knowing. Welcome to the free fall. Welcome to the world of groundlessness.

You're going to do great here.

Thank you for your courage in walking this path. Thank you for being here.

**[Final slide remains on screen: "Peace of Thinking You Know" vs. "Peace of Not Knowing"]**
