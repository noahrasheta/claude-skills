# The War Within: Finding Peace in a World of Violence
_A 20-Minute Dharma Talk on the Three Poisons_
---
## Opening: The Weight of the World
Good morning, everyone. Before we begin, I want to share something I say at the start of all my talks: You don't need to use what you learn from Buddhism to become a Buddhist. You can use what you learn to simply be a better whatever you already are.
This week, I found myself sitting with the news, feeling this familiar heaviness in my chest. Again. Another school shooting. Ongoing war. More hatred manifesting as violence in our world. And I sat there, reading the news, thinking of my own kids, and the pain of the parents who lost their children this week. I was feeling something between anger and despair, asking myself the same question I've asked so many times before: "What will it ever take for the world to know peace?"
Maybe you've felt this too – this sense of helplessness when you see the violence, the hatred, the seemingly endless cycle of harm we inflict on each other. You ask yourself, "What can we do? What can possibly be done when it feels like the world is drowning in its own poisons?"
I saw this same question unfolding in the comments on social media, and the complete inability to agree on what can be done, and the additional anger and frustration that arises when it seems no one can answer the question "What can we do?" This made me think, maybe we're asking the wrong question. Instead of "What can we do?" – this abstract, overwhelming question, that no one is ever going to agree on – It might be more wise to ask something more specific, more personal, like… "What can I do?"
And even more importantly: "What's happening inside me that contributes to the lack of peace in the world?"
Because here's what I've come to understand: that hatred we see manifested in acts of violence and war, that greed that drives people to take what isn't theirs, that ignorance that allows someone to believe that destroying life will somehow solve their problems – these don't come from somewhere "out there." They come from the same roots that exist within each of us.
## The Ripple Reality
We all want world peace. We want to wake up to news of cooperation instead of conflict, healing instead of harm. But peace is generally not a top-down phenomenon that can be legislated or decreed into existence.
Peace is a grassroots movement that starts in individual hearts. It moves outward in ripples: a peaceful heart creates a peaceful home. A peaceful home influences a peaceful family. Peaceful families build peaceful neighborhoods. Peaceful neighborhoods form peaceful communities. And peaceful communities, eventually, create a peaceful world.
But we keep trying to work backwards. We demand world peace while waging war in our own hearts. We call for others to lay down their weapons while we stay armed with our own resentments, our own hatred, our own violence – even if it only manifests in our thoughts and words, or social media comments, rather than our actions.
The person who walked into that school with a gun was someone's neighbor. Someone's child. Someone who sat in classrooms and ate lunch in cafeterias just like we all have. They weren't born violent. They weren't inherently evil. Somewhere along the way, the poisons that exist in all of us – the seeds of ignorance, greed, and hatred – were watered and nurtured until they grew into something monstrous.
And here's the uncomfortable truth we need to face: the same seeds exist within each of us. The difference is not in the presence or absence of these seeds, but in how we tend to them. The hatred that pulls a trigger comes from the same root as the hatred I feel in traffic when someone cuts me off. The scale is different – drastically different – but the poison is the same.
When I feel that flash of rage at the driver who cut me off, when I fantasize for even a moment about them getting what they deserve, I'm watering the same seed that, under different conditions, with different nurturing, could grow into something terrifying.
## The Three Poisons: Our Inner War
In Buddhism, we talk about the three poisons that contaminate our minds and hearts: ignorance, greed, and hatred. They're real forces that shape our thoughts, emotions, and actions every single day.
I want you to imagine yourself as a tree. Your roots, deep in the ground, represent your core beliefs about yourself and the world. The trunk represents your thoughts – growing up from those beliefs, shaped by them. The branches and leaves that reach out from the trunk are your emotions and feelings. They are your response to the winds and the weather of daily life, shaped by your thoughts and beliefs. And finally, the **fruit** that the tree bears represents your **actions**—what you actually say and do in the world. That fruit is the tangible outcome of the entire system. The visible results of everything happening inside you.
When poison enters the roots of a tree, it affects everything that grows from them. The trunk becomes weak or twisted. The branches wither or grow wild. And the fruit? The fruit becomes poisonous, too, capable of poisoning others who consume it.
This is what happens when the three poisons infiltrate our being. They contaminate our beliefs, distort our thoughts, inflame our emotions, and ultimately, poison our actions. And our poisoned actions can poison others, creating a cycle of toxicity that spreads through families, communities, and yes, even the entire world.
### Ignorance: The First Poison
Let's start with ignorance. This isn't just "not knowing" something. It's actively misunderstanding the nature of reality. It's seeing the world through a distorted lens and believing that distortion is truth.
The person who commits an act of violence operates from profound ignorance. They believe, somehow, that violence will solve their pain. That destroying others will build them up. That causing suffering will ease their own suffering (hurt people, hurt people). This is ignorance at its most tragic – the complete misunderstanding of how cause and effect actually work.
But we all operate from ignorance in smaller ways every day. We say things like "You made me angry" instead of "I experienced anger when you did that." See the difference? The first assumes that others have control over our internal states. The second recognizes that our emotions arise from within us, based on our interpretation of events.
We believe our happiness depends entirely on external circumstances – if I just had more money, if my partner would just change, if my boss would just appreciate me, then I'd be happy. This is ignorance. We're misunderstanding where happiness actually comes from.
Perhaps the deepest ignorance is the illusion of separateness. We see ourselves as isolated individuals, separate from others, separate from nature, separate from the world. The shooter sees their victims not as fellow human beings with families, dreams, and fears just like their own, but as "others," as "enemies," as "problems to be eliminated."
But even in our daily lives, we operate from this ignorance of separation. We think we can hate someone without that hatred affecting us. We think we can wish ill on others without poisoning our own hearts. We think we can damage the world around us without damaging ourselves. This is the fundamental ignorance that underlies all violence, whether it's a harsh word or a horrible act.
### Greed: The Second Poison
The second poison is greed or attachment, but not just in the sense of wanting money or possessions. It's the desperate grasping energy that says, "I MUST have this. I NEED this. I'll do anything to get this."
For someone who commits violence, this greed might manifest as a desperate need for control in a life that feels out of control. A desperate need for significance in a world where they feel invisible. A desperate need for revenge against perceived wrongs. It's the grasping that becomes so tight, so desperate, that they're willing to destroy everything to get what they think they need.
But we all experience this poison. It shows up as our need to be right in arguments – that desperate grasping for validation. Our need for approval – that constant checking of social media for likes and comments. Our need for things to go according to our plans – that tight grip on how we think life should unfold.
Notice how the tighter we grasp, the more violent we become when things slip through our fingers. When someone challenges our need to be right, we might lash out with cruel words. When we don't get the approval we're seeking, we might become bitter and resentful. When life doesn't go according to our plans, we might rage against reality itself.
The energy of greed is the energy of war – the determination to take what we want regardless of the cost to others. And while most of us would never take a life for what we want, how often do we take someone's peace? Their dignity? Their joy?
### Hatred: The Third Poison
The third poison is hatred or aversion – the active energy of pushing away and rejection. It's the voice that says, "I don't want this. Get it away from me."
For someone who commits an act of extreme violence, this hatred has consumed them. It's the ultimate rejection – the rejection of life itself, both others' and often their own. It's saying "This should not exist" and taking action to destroy it.
But hatred shows up in our lives in countless smaller ways. It's the person we can't forgive, carrying that resentment like a hot coal in our hearts. It's the situation we resist with every fiber of our being, exhausting ourselves fighting against reality. It's the parts of ourselves we reject, the internal violence we commit against our own hearts and minds.
Every act of violence begins with an internal "NO" to what is. No, this person shouldn't have cut me off in traffic. No, my partner shouldn't have said that. No, I shouldn't be feeling this emotion. No, life shouldn't be this way.
And from that "NO" comes the push to eliminate, to destroy, to make it go away. In its extreme form, this becomes physical violence. In its everyday form, it becomes the thousand small violences we commit – the silent treatment, the harsh word, the withheld affection, the wish for someone's failure.
I want you to think about this: when we hear about a mass shooting, we often learn that the shooter was filled with hatred – hatred for specific groups, hatred for society, hatred for life itself. But where does such hatred come from? It doesn't appear overnight. It grows from seeds that are watered over time. Every small hatred we nurture, every resentment we feed, every "us versus them" thought we entertain – we're watering those same seeds.
## The Antidotes: Cultivating Peace
So what do we do about that? Now, here's something important to understand: we cannot eliminate these poisons entirely. They're part of being human. Even the most enlightened beings experience the arising of these poisons. The difference is in how quickly they recognize them and how they choose to respond.
It's like being a gardener who knows which plants are weeds. You can't prevent weeds from sprouting – their seeds are everywhere, carried by wind and birds and time. But you can learn to recognize them quickly and choose not to water them. You can choose to nurture different seeds instead.
For each poison, there is an antidote. Not a cure – because these poisons will keep arising as long as we're human – but an antidote that neutralizes their effect and transforms their energy.
### Wisdom Counters Ignorance
The antidote to ignorance is wisdom, which we can practice as **Clarity** or **Curiosity. Wisdom is** seeing clearly, understanding how things actually work.
When ignorance says, "That person is my enemy," wisdom sees, "This person who hurt me is also suffering. Happy people don't go around causing harm. They must be in pain."
When ignorance says, "I am separate and alone," wisdom recognizes, "Their pain and my pain are not separate. We're all in this together, all struggling, all wanting to be happy, all afraid of suffering."
When ignorance says, "This will last forever," wisdom remembers, "This feeling will pass. This situation will change. Nothing is permanent."
Wisdom doesn't mean having all the answers. It means seeing clearly enough to respond skillfully rather than react blindly.
### Gratitude Counters Greed
The antidote to greed is gratitude – the recognition of what we already have, the appreciation for what's already here.
Greed keeps us focused on what's missing, what's wrong, what we don't have. It's a clenched fist, grasping desperately. Gratitude opens that fist, relaxes that grip, and allows us to receive what's already present.
When we're grateful for what we have, we stop violently grasping for what we don't have. When we appreciate this moment, we stop desperately trying to force a different moment into existence. When we're thankful for the people in our lives as they are, we stop trying to forcefully change them into who we think they should be.
Gratitude doesn't eliminate desire, but it shifts the balance. It reminds our nervous system that right here, right now, we are okay. And from that place of okayness, we can act with generosity rather than desperation.
### Loving-kindness Counters Hatred
The antidote to hatred is loving-kindness or what we might call compassion or understanding – not forced positivity or fake niceness, but the genuine wish for all beings to be free from suffering. This is not a sentimental, fluffy feeling. It's a courageous practice. It doesn't mean you have to agree with your crazy relative. It means you make an effort to see the human being behind the opinion. To wonder, _What experiences led them to believe this? What are they afraid of?_ It's the simple, revolutionary act of choosing to soften when your instinct is to harden.
This starts with ourselves. We can't give what we don't have. If we're at war with ourselves, we'll be at war with the world. If we can't offer kindness to our own hearts, our kindness to others will be hollow and unsustainable.
Loving-kindness doesn't mean liking everyone or approving of all actions. It means recognizing the basic humanity in everyone, including those who have caused harm. It means wishing for the end of the suffering that drives people to cause suffering.
When someone commits an act of violence, loving-kindness doesn't excuse their action. But it recognizes that this person was once a baby, innocent and full of potential. Something went wrong. Many things went wrong. And while we must protect society from harmful actions, we can still wish for the healing of the pain that created the perpetrator.
## Call to Action: Two Practices
So what do we do with all of this? How do we begin to transform these poisons within ourselves and contribute to peace in the world? I want to offer you two practical practices that you can begin today.
### Practice 1: The Daily Poison Check-In
Each evening, take a few minutes to review your day. Sit quietly and ask yourself three questions:
"Where did ignorance show up today?" Maybe you assumed you knew someone's intentions without asking. Maybe you believed your happiness depended on something external. Maybe you forgot your interdependence with others.
"Where did greed arise?" Perhaps you grasped too tightly to being right in a conversation. Maybe you desperately needed approval or recognition. Maybe you tried to control something that wasn't yours to control.
"Where did hatred manifest?" Did you push away an uncomfortable feeling? Did you wish harm on someone, even briefly? Did you reject some part of yourself or your experience?
Don't judge yourself when you notice these poisons. We're not trying to shame ourselves into change. We're building awareness. We're becoming gardeners who can recognize weeds in our mental garden.
Then ask yourself: "What antidote could I have applied?" How could wisdom have helped you see more clearly? How could gratitude have relaxed your grasping? How could loving-kindness have softened your resistance?
This simple practice builds the awareness that is the first step to transformation.
### Practice 2: The Ripple Practice
When you feel overwhelmed by world events, when the violence and hatred seem too much to bear, try this:
Place your hand on your heart and say: "May I be free from ignorance, greed, and hatred. May I be at peace."
Then expand outward: "May my family be free from ignorance, greed, and hatred. May they be at peace."
Continue expanding: "May my neighborhood be free from these poisons. May my community be at peace. May my country be at peace. May all beings everywhere be free from ignorance, greed, and hatred."
Start where you are, with what you can actually influence – your own heart, your own mind. You can't end all war, but you can end the war within yourself. You can't eliminate all hatred, but you can transform the hatred in your own heart. You can't cure the world's ignorance, but you can seek wisdom in your own understanding.
This isn't a passive practice. When you genuinely cultivate peace within yourself, it changes how you interact with everyone around you. It changes the energy you bring to every situation. It changes the seeds you water in others.
## Closing: The Choice Point
We continually have a choice. Not just once, but every day, multiple times a day. When ignorance arises, we can choose wisdom. When greed arises, we can choose gratitude. When hatred arises, we can choose loving-kindness.
The person who committed this recent act of violence made their choice. We can't undo that. The damage is done, the lives are lost, the trauma ripples outward. But we can make different choices. And every time we choose the antidote over the poison, we add a drop of peace to the world.
It might seem insignificant – choosing patience over anger in traffic, choosing gratitude over complaint at dinner, choosing understanding over judgment with our families. But remember the ripple effect. Remember that every act of violence started as a seed, watered over time. And every act of peace also starts as a seed.
The question isn't "What will it take for the world to know peace?" That's too big, too abstract, too far from our direct influence. The question is "Will I choose peace in this moment?" Because world peace isn't some far-off goal that will be achieved through treaties and agreements. World peace is the accumulation of billions of individual moments of choosing peace over violence, wisdom over ignorance, gratitude over greed, love over hatred.
Your peace matters. Your choice matters. The poisons you transform in your own heart create ripples that extend far beyond what you can see.
The tree that you are – with your roots of belief, your trunk of thought, your branches of emotion, and your fruit of action – that tree is in your care. You are the gardener. You choose which seeds to water. You choose whether to nurture poison or medicine.
And in a world that sometimes feels overwhelmingly poisoned, your choice to cultivate healing, to grow different fruit, to offer shade and sustenance rather than toxicity – that choice is an act of revolution. It's an act of hope. It's an act of peace.
The war within you is the only war you can truly end. But when you end that war, when you make peace with yourself, when you transform your poisons, you become a force for peace in the world. Not through grand gestures or dramatic actions, but through the quiet, consistent choice to meet each moment with as much wisdom, gratitude, and loving-kindness as you can muster.
That's what you can do. That's what I can do. That's what we all can do.
One moment at a time. One choice at a time. One heart at a time.
Until the ripples meet and merge, and the world we long for – the world of peace – emerges not from above, and not from outside, but from within.
Thank you for sharing this moment with me, and for your own commitment to this path of greater inner peace. May we all be free from ignorance, greed, and hatred.
Thank you for listening, until next time!
