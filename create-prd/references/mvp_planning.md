# MVP Planning Guide

## What is an MVP?

A Minimum Viable Product is the smallest product that:
1. Solves a core problem for users
2. Provides enough value that people will use/pay for it
3. Generates learning about your business model
4. Can be built quickly with minimal resources

## MVP is NOT

- A broken or buggy product
- Half of a product poorly done
- The smallest product you can build
- An excuse for bad user experience
- A one-time release

## Types of MVPs

### 1. Concierge MVP
Manually perform the service for users
- **Best for**: Service-based solutions
- **Example**: Manually curate content before building algorithm
- **Pros**: Deep learning, immediate feedback
- **Cons**: Doesn't scale, time-intensive

### 2. Wizard of Oz MVP
Appears automated but is manual behind the scenes
- **Best for**: Complex automation
- **Example**: Chatbot with human responses
- **Pros**: Tests full experience, faster than building
- **Cons**: Hard to maintain, doesn't scale

### 3. Landing Page MVP
Single page describing product with signup
- **Best for**: Testing demand
- **Example**: Product description with email capture
- **Pros**: Very fast, tests interest
- **Cons**: Doesn't test actual product

### 4. Single Feature MVP
One core feature that solves main problem
- **Best for**: Clear value proposition
- **Example**: Instagram started as photo sharing only
- **Pros**: Focused learning, easier to build
- **Cons**: May not show full potential

### 5. Prototype MVP
Interactive mockup or demo
- **Best for**: UI/UX validation
- **Example**: Clickable Figma prototype
- **Pros**: Fast iteration, visual testing
- **Cons**: Not real functionality

## Defining Your MVP Scope

### Step 1: Identify Core Value
What is the ONE thing your product must do well?
- What problem must it solve?
- What value must it deliver?
- What would make users come back?

### Step 2: List All Features
Brain dump everything you could build.

### Step 3: Apply MoSCoW Method
- **Must Have**: Core value, without these the product fails
- **Should Have**: Important but not vital for launch
- **Could Have**: Nice to have, improves experience
- **Won't Have**: Explicitly not in MVP

### Step 4: Validate with User Stories
For each Must Have feature:
- Can a user complete their primary goal?
- Does it solve the core problem?
- Is there a simpler way?

### Step 5: Technical Reality Check
- Can you build this in 4-12 weeks?
- Do you have the skills/resources?
- What's the simplest implementation?

## MVP Feature Prioritization Framework

### Value vs. Effort Matrix

```
High Value, Low Effort → BUILD FIRST
High Value, High Effort → BUILD SECOND
Low Value, Low Effort → MAYBE LATER
Low Value, High Effort → DON'T BUILD
```

### Scoring Criteria

**Value Score (1-10)**
- User impact
- Problem solving
- Differentiation
- Revenue potential

**Effort Score (1-10)**
- Development time
- Technical complexity
- Maintenance burden
- Risk/uncertainty

### Priority = Value / Effort

## MVP Success Metrics

### Engagement Metrics
- Daily/Weekly Active Users
- Session duration
- Feature usage
- Retention rate

### Value Metrics

- Time saved
- User satisfaction (NPS)
- Task completion rate

### Business Metrics
- Conversion rate
- Customer acquisition cost
- Lifetime value
- Churn rate

## MVP Launch Strategy

### Soft Launch
1. Friends and family
2. Beta testers
3. Early access list
4. Limited geography
5. Public launch

### Feedback Loops
- In-app feedback widget
- Weekly user interviews
- Analytics tracking
- Support ticket analysis
- Social media monitoring

### Iteration Cadence
- Daily: Bug fixes
- Weekly: Small improvements
- Bi-weekly: Feature releases
- Monthly: Strategy review

## Post-MVP Roadmap

### Signals to Expand
- Consistent user growth
- Positive feedback patterns
- Clear feature requests
- Willingness to pay
- Technical stability

### Signals to Pivot
- Low engagement
- High churn
- Unclear value proposition
- No product-market fit
- Better opportunity identified

## MVP Checklist

### Before Building
- [ ] Core problem validated
- [ ] Target user defined
- [ ] Single value prop clear
- [ ] Features list < 5
- [ ] 4-12 week timeline
- [ ] Success metrics defined

### Before Launching
- [ ] Core flow works
- [ ] Major bugs fixed
- [ ] Analytics implemented
- [ ] Feedback system ready
- [ ] Support process defined
- [ ] Landing page ready

### After Launching
- [ ] Daily metrics review
- [ ] Weekly user interviews
- [ ] Bi-weekly iterations
- [ ] Monthly strategy review
- [ ] Document learnings
- [ ] Plan next features

## Common MVP Mistakes

1. **Feature Creep**: Adding "just one more thing"
2. **Perfectionism**: Polishing instead of launching
3. **Wrong Audience**: Building for everyone
4. **No Metrics**: Flying blind without data
5. **Ignoring Feedback**: Building in isolation
6. **Premature Scaling**: Growing before product-market fit
