# Lean Startup Methodology Guide

## Core Principles

### 1. Build-Measure-Learn
The fundamental feedback loop of lean startup:
- **Build**: Create a Minimum Viable Product (MVP)
- **Measure**: Collect data on how customers use it
- **Learn**: Validate or invalidate your hypotheses
- **Iterate**: Pivot or persevere based on learnings

### 2. Validated Learning
Every feature and effort should be designed to test a specific hypothesis about your business.

### 3. Innovation Accounting
Track actionable metrics, not vanity metrics:
- **Actionable**: Metrics you can act on to improve
- **Accessible**: Easy to understand and report
- **Auditable**: Data integrity you can trust

## Key Concepts

### Minimum Viable Product (MVP)
The smallest thing you can build to start the learning process:
- Has just enough features to satisfy early customers
- Provides feedback for future development
- Minimizes time and resources spent

### Pivot or Persevere
Based on validated learning:
- **Pivot**: Change strategy without changing vision
- **Persevere**: Continue with current strategy

### Types of Pivots
1. **Zoom-in Pivot**: Single feature becomes whole product
2. **Zoom-out Pivot**: Whole product becomes single feature
3. **Customer Segment Pivot**: Same solution, different audience
4. **Customer Need Pivot**: Same audience, different problem
5. **Platform Pivot**: Change from application to platform or vice versa
6. **Business Architecture Pivot**: High margin/low volume ↔ low margin/high volume
7. **Value Capture Pivot**: Change monetization strategy
8. **Engine of Growth Pivot**: Change growth strategy
9. **Channel Pivot**: Change distribution channel
10. **Technology Pivot**: Same solution via different technology

## Hypothesis-Driven Development

### Structure Your Hypotheses
**Format**: We believe [this capability] will result in [this outcome]. We will know we're right when we see [this measurable signal].

### Example Hypotheses
1. **Problem Hypothesis**: We believe busy professionals struggle to maintain meditation practice
2. **Solution Hypothesis**: We believe a 5-minute guided meditation app will help them maintain consistency
3. **Channel Hypothesis**: We believe we can reach them through LinkedIn and productivity blogs
4. **Revenue Hypothesis**: We believe they will pay $9.99/month for premium content

## Metrics That Matter

### Pirate Metrics (AARRR)
1. **Acquisition**: How do users find you?
2. **Activation**: Do users have a good first experience?
3. **Retention**: Do users come back?
4. **Revenue**: How do you make money?
5. **Referral**: Do users tell others?

### Cohort Analysis
Track groups of users over time rather than aggregate metrics.

### A/B Testing
Test hypotheses by comparing two versions with real users.

## Lean Canvas Components

### Problem Box
- List top 3 problems
- Existing alternatives
- High-level concept

### Solution Box
- Top 3 features
- Clear value proposition
- Unfair advantage

### Metrics Box
- Key activities to measure
- Success criteria
- Learning goals

### Customer Box
- Customer segments
- Early adopters
- User personas

## Common Lean Startup Mistakes

1. **Building Too Much**: Adding features before validating core value
2. **Falling in Love with Solution**: Not listening to customer feedback
3. **Analysis Paralysis**: Researching forever instead of building
4. **Vanity Metrics**: Focusing on metrics that don't drive decisions
5. **Premature Scaling**: Growing before product-market fit

## Applying Lean to Your PRD

### Start With Problems, Not Solutions
- Document the problem thoroughly
- Include evidence and validation
- Be willing to pivot the solution

### Define Clear Hypotheses
- Make them testable
- Set specific success criteria
- Plan how to measure

### Keep MVP Truly Minimal
- Maximum 5 features
- Each feature tests a hypothesis
- Build just enough to learn

### Plan for Iteration
- Expect to pivot
- Document learnings
- Update PRD as you learn

## Quick Checklist

Before building:
- [ ] Problem is validated with evidence
- [ ] Solution is a clear hypothesis
- [ ] MVP is truly minimal
- [ ] Success metrics are defined
- [ ] Learning goals are clear
- [ ] Pivot triggers are identified
