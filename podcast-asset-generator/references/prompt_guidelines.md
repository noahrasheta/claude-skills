## Summary Guidelines

1. **Hook** (1-2 sentences): What question or problem does this episode address?
2. **Core Content** (2-3 sentences): What are the main topics/teachings explored?
3. **Takeaway** (1-2 sentences): What will listeners learn or gain?

**Example:**
```
What does it really mean to let go? In this episode, we explore the Buddhist concept 
of non-attachment through the lens of modern psychology and practical daily experience. 
Drawing on ancient wisdom and contemporary neuroscience, we examine why our attempts to 
control outcomes often create more suffering, and how a practice of gentle awareness can 
transform our relationship with uncertainty. You'll discover practical techniques for 
recognizing attachment patterns and cultivating a more easeful way of being with whatever 
life presents.
```

### Summary Tone
- **Conversational yet professional**: Friendly but not casual
- **Present tense** for describing episode content
- **Action-oriented**: "We explore," "You'll discover"
- **Specific but accessible**: Concrete enough to be meaningful, general enough to intrigue
- **Avoid buzzwords**: Use plain language over jargon

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Generic images**: "Person meditating" → Too clichéd, not memorable
2. **Text-heavy videos**: Hard to read in 10 seconds
3. **Overly complex prompts**: Simpler is often better
4. **Mismatched tone**: Ensure visual style matches content mood
5. **Clickbait summaries**: Be authentic and accurate
